  Taken from discussion on Piazza @165. Variables only count as declared if they appear in a `var <name> (= <expr>)?` statement. Expands on violations/type/undeclared/test_assignment_from_undeclared-but-assigned_variable.

  Added from part 3, only one error can be reported per statement. Logical and arithmetic statements are evaluated in a left-associative way, which implies the errors shown above.
