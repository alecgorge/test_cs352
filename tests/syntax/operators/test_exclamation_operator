  The exclamation operator (representing negation) can only be used with an ID or a parenthetical expression. The expression will be converted to a boolean before the operation is applied.

  By the spec, expressions such as `!1`, `!"some string"`, and `!false` are technically illegal. However, the TAs have said that these cases will not actually be tested, and a grammar that allows them will pass their tests. Because of this ambiguity, those cases are not tested here.
