# CS 352 Unofficial Spec

This directory aims to serve as a more hierarchical version of the spec for the Spring 2015 CS 352 compiler project.

The goal is to provide a single source for the entire spec of the project that is also more easy to read and reference so as to avoid any confusion, ambiguity, or concern about the priority of updates to the spec as the project goes on.
