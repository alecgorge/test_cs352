# 3 Data Types
This section defines the different simple types of data that miniscript understands, namely Numbers, Strings and Booleans.

For simplicity, this section does NOT cover any complex types/structures that are comprised of these simple types. For those, see the [Data Structures section](../data_structures/index.md).

This section also does NOT cover storing these data types. For that, see the [Variables section](../variables/index.md).
