# 7 Flow Control
Flow control is the application of conditional expressions to determine the order in which statements will be evaluated. This includes omission, repetition, and termination of statements and structures to achieve a desired functionality.

Miniscript supports a small subset of the normal flow control statements found in most languages (like C).

Flow Control operations are statement-level expressions, meaning they must appear on their own and not as part of another statement. However, these operations are allowed to be nested inside of each other (for those that support body elements).
